# 📧 Lockdown Chat Template. 
Plans and sketches for creating a P2P based messenger for communication with Russian citizens who have already had most of their communication with the rest of the world blocked.

# ⚙️ Technologies:
Electron: For the desktop application.
React: For the interface (list of chats, window messages).
Node.js + Express: For the local API (registration, authorization).
SQLite: For local storage of users and messages.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the interface in the style of Telegram.
Socket.IO: For exchanging messages at first.

# 📎Functionality:
Registration and authorization of users.
Basic interface: sidebar with a list of chats, main window with messages.
Sending and receiving text messages.
Local data storage.

# ❗This is the basic version. For a group of 5-6 people, a local server (on one of the computers) or P2P will do.
